        Are you tired of all your notes being all over the place? <br />
        Do you wish that you could access all your notes with just one click?
        <br />
        <b> Well you're at the right place!</b> <br />
        We've created MyNotes, an online resource sharing platform where you can
        not only access notes, but also help your community out by uploading
        them too!
        <br />
        Here at MyNotes, as the name suggests, the notes are all yours and
        they're just a click away! (We know! Sounds pretty convenient right?)
